1.  Introduction

   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040] protocol operations are
   authenticated and authorized as part of the Authentication,
   Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework.  An accounting record
   needs to be created as part of the same framework for each of these
   operations to satisfy the accounting part of AAA.  Having an
   accounting record that is consistent across vendors allows for the
   operator to compare operations across devices from different vendors.
   This document defines such a record and a corresponding YANG data
   model (ietf-netconf-am.yang).

   The rest of this document will use NETCONF to imply both NETCONF and
   RESTCONF, but where applicable will call out each protocol
   specifically.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in NETCONF [RFC6241] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  client

   o  server

   o  session

   o  user

2.  Accounting Record

   An accounting record for NETCONF consists of the following fields.

   +------+------+----+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   | acct | date | sr | sess | tas | use | gro | pat | act | rul | sta |
   | -    | -    | c- | ion- | k-  | r   | ups | h   | ion | e   | tus |
   | code | time | ip | id   | id  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   +------+------+----+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   +------+------+----+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   where:

   acct-code: START indicates a start of a new record, NONE a
   continuation, and STOP the end of the record.

   date-time: The date and time when the operation was performed (UTC
   Timezone)

   src-ip: The source IP address that was used to request the operation

   session-id: The session-id in case of NETCONF and would be blank in
   case of RESTCONF

   task-id: Used to track a accounting record in case it needs to split
   for uploading or storing.  The id is a monotonically increasing
   number assigned by the server.

   user: The NETCONF user that requesed this operation.

   groups: The group the user belongs to.

   path: The path in the NACM rule on which the operations is being
   performed

   action: The action in the NACM rule

   rule: The rule in the NACM that was used to authorize the action.

   status: Whether the operations was permitted or denied.

3.  Data Model Definitions

3.1.  Data Organization

   The following diagram highlights the contents and structure of the
   Accounting YANG module.

            +--ro status?       nacm:action-type

3.2.  YANG Module

   The following YANG module specifies the normative NETCONF content
   that MUST be supported by the server.

   The "ietf-netconf-am" YANG module imports typedefs from YANG-TYPES
   [RFC6991], from NETCONF [RFC6241] and from NACM [RFC6536].

   <CODE BEGINS> file "ietf-netconf-am@2017-03-13.yang"


   <CODE ENDS>

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes two requests of IANA.

   The first request is to register one URI in "The IETF XML Registry".
   Following the format in The IETF XML Registry [RFC3688], the
   following needs to be registered.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-am

   Registrant Contact: The IESG

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace

   The second request is to register one module in the "YANG Module
   Names" registry.  Following the format in YANG [RFC7950], the
   following needs to be registered.

   Name: ietf-netconf-am

   Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-am

   Prefix: nam

   Reference: RFC XXXX

   Note to RFC Editor - Please replace XXXX with the RFC id assigned to
   this draft.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed using
   the NETCONF protocol.  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
   transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
   SSH.

   Most of the data nodes defined in this YANG module are readonly, i.e.
   config false, and are therefore not vulnerable in network
   environments.  However, they might contain data that might be
   sensitive and should be protected with the right NACM [RFC6536]
   rules.
