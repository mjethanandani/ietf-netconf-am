    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC6241">NETCONF</xref> and <xref
      target="RFC8040">RESTCONF</xref> protocol operations are authenticated
      and authorized as part of the Authentication, Authorization and
      Accounting (AAA) framework. An accounting record needs to be created as
      part of the same framework for each of these operations to satisfy the
      accounting part of AAA. Having an accounting record that is consistent
      across vendors allows for the operator to compare operations across
      devices from different vendors. This document defines such a record and
      a corresponding YANG data model (ietf-netconf-am.yang).</t>

      <t>The rest of this document will use NETCONF to imply both NETCONF and
      RESTCONF, but where applicable will call out each protocol
      specifically.</t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The following terms are defined in <xref
        target="RFC6241">NETCONF</xref> and are not redefined here:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>client</t>

            <t>server</t>

            <t>session</t>

            <t>user</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Accounting Record">
      <t>An accounting record for NETCONF consists of the following
      fields.</t>

      <texttable title="">
        <ttcol>acct-code</ttcol>

        <ttcol>date-time</ttcol>

        <ttcol>src-ip</ttcol>

        <ttcol>task-id</ttcol>

        <ttcol>path</ttcol>

        <ttcol>action</ttcol>

        <ttcol>rule</ttcol>

        <ttcol>status</ttcol>
      </texttable>

      <t>where:</t>

      <t>acct-code: START indicates a start of a new record, NONE a
      continuation, and STOP the end of the record.</t>

      <t>date-time: The date and time when the operation was performed (UTC
      Timezone)</t>

      <t>src-ip: The source IP address that was used to request the
      operation</t>

      <t>session-id: The session-id in case of NETCONF and would be blank in
      case of RESTCONF</t>

      <t>task-id: Used to track a accounting record in case it needs to split
      for uploading or storing. The id is a monotonically increasing number
      assigned by the server.</t>

      <t>user: The NETCONF user that requesed this operation.</t>

      <t>groups: The group the user belongs to.</t>

      <t>path: The path in the NACM rule on which the operations is being
      performed</t>

      <t>action: The action in the NACM rule</t>

      <t>rule: The rule in the NACM that was used to authorize the action.</t>

      <t>status: Whether the operations was permitted or denied.</t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document makes two requests of IANA.</t>

      <t>The first request is to register one URI in "The IETF XML Registry".
      Following the format in <xref target="RFC3688">The IETF XML
      Registry</xref>, the following needs to be registered.</t>

      <t>URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-am</t>

      <t>Registrant Contact: The IESG</t>

      <t>XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace</t>

      <t>The second request is to register one module in the "YANG Module
      Names" registry. Following the format in <xref
      target="RFC7950">YANG</xref>, the following needs to be registered.</t>

      <t>Name: ietf-netconf-am</t>

      <t>Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-am</t>

      <t>Prefix: nam</t>

      <t>Reference: RFC XXXX</t>

      <t>Note to RFC Editor - Please replace XXXX with the RFC id assigned to
      this draft.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed using
      the NETCONF protocol. The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
      layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is SSH.</t>

      <t>Most of the data nodes defined in this YANG module are readonly, i.e.
      config false, and are therefore not vulnerable in network environments.
      However, they might contain data that might be sensitive and should be
      protected with the right <xref target="RFC6536">NACM</xref> rules.</t>
